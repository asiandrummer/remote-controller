= Remote Controller

== Simple Remote Controller UI mockup

=== Requirement
We want a html5 page that works on iOS5 that shows the ball and groove setup here.
On pushing the the ball on up/down/right/left we want to execute the appropriate command.
(For the purpose of this exercise, show some visual indication on the page that the right action is performed.)

The assets for ball and groove are attached to this document.
Feel free to modify or use external assets as required.

=== Additional Requirements
We are looking for a web page that is as close to the native app in performance and feel of the control UI.
